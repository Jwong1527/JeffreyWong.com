        Iâ€™m currently a senior at the University at Buffalo pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
        <br /><br />
        My passion lies in full stack development and cybersecurity, and I've worked on projects that span frontend UI/UX, backend services, real-time messaging, and WebSocket protocols.
        <br /><br />
        Outside of tech, I lift, play basketball, and explore new food spots. Music and the piano keep me grounded and inspired.
